  - With reference to Claude GUI Automation Refactoring Instructions assess the {file}. Briefly describe its purpose and how it fits into the overall project, the major functions or classes it contains. Do not refactor yetâ€”just return your assessment.
  - Based on your assessment, propose a detailed refactoring plan for {file}. Include specific improvements such as function extraction, renaming, logic simplification, or restructuring; explain how these changes improve maintainability or readability; and note any dependencies or potential side effects. Wait for my approval before proceeding.
  - Apply the refactor to {file}. Output the complete refactored code in one block with minimal inline comments where necessary to explain any non-obvious changes. Do not modify other files or make assumptions about external dependencies unless instructed.
